# Pascal's Dots (Sierpinski Triangle)

An SDL2/C++ project for Windows 11

An app concerning chaos theory (I think?) that demonstrates the pattern when placing a random point on an equilateral triangle. Then, the app creates more points from that by placing dots at the midpoint of the previous position and a random vertex on the triangle. 

Got the inspiration from some random Instagram video

Underlying logic and graphics made entirely with C++ and SDL2, compiled with g++

Controls:
- Left click anywhere inside the triangle to start the program 
- Press "R" to reset the program
