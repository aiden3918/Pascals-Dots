# Pascal's Dots (Sierpinski Triangle)

An SDL2/C++ project for Windows 11

An app concerning chaos theory (I think?) that demonstrates the pattern when placing a random point on an equilateral triangle. Then, the app creates more points from that by placing dots at the midpoint of the previous position and a random vertex on the triangle. 

Got the inspiration from some random Instagram video
